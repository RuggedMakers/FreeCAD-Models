# FreeCAD-Models
Largely devoted to FDM/FFF/3D Printing models and (very good) instructional material for different FreeCAD workbenches.

## Sketcher Workbench
The 'sketcher.pdf' is a very thorough and easy to read treatment of the Sketcher Workbench on FreeCAD. Thanks to @`chrisb` (Christoph Blaue) and others, on the [FreeCAD Forums](https://forum.freecad.org).
